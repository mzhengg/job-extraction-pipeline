# Job Extraction Pipeline

Software engineering is one of the most in-demand, highest paying jobs currently. There's lots of room for growth and the industry is expected to grow by 25% through the next decade according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics <https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm>. But this industry is constantly changing and new positions are opening up all the time. This project aims to track the number of positions open for the various specialities within software engineering so that aspiring software engineers can pivot into growing fields, learn the necessary skills, and get a job with a good growth outlook.

## Technologies:

* Python (Selenium, Boto3, Pandas, Psycopg2)
* AWS (S3, Fargate, MWAA, Redshift)
* Airflow
* Docker

## Overview of Terraform

An infrastructure-as-code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-premise resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle.  

In other words, it is a tool for managing and provisioning computer data centers through code instead of manual processes.  

## Overview of Docker

Docker is a platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update, and manage containers. Containers are a package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, dependencies, etc. Containers are isolated from each other and can be ran in different environments (Windows, macOS, GCP, etc.). They allow reproducibility, local experiments, and running pipelines on the cloud.

### General Workflow
Dockerfile: a text file you create that builds a Docker image.  

Docker image: a file containing instructions to build a Docker container.  

Docker container: a running instance of a Docker image
* Since a Docker image is just a snapshot, any modifications performed in the container will be lost upon restarting the container  

Docker compose (docker-compose.yml): a file to deploy, combine, and configure many Docker images at once.  

Dockerfile -> (build) -> Image -> (configure) -> docker-compose.yml -> (run) -> Container  

Docker volume: file system mounted on Docker container to preserve data generated by the running container (stored on the host, independent of the container life cycle.  

“Docker rule” is to outsource every process to its own container.  

## Overview of Airflow

Apache Airflow is the most popular data workflow orchestration tool.  

## How to Setup and Deploy Dashboard

### 1) Setup Infrastucture using Terraform

Terraform is used to set up the AWS infrastructure (S3, Fargate, MWAA, Redshift).  

#### Instructions

1. Get AWS keys by following these steps:
    - Sign into AWS console
    - Click on `username`
    - Click on `security credentials`
    - Click on `create access key`  

2. Create a `.env` file in the main directory. This will be the file that stores all the important AWS access keys and redshift credentials for running the data pipeline. Store the AWS access keys you got from step 1 in this file.

2. Set these environment variables (get the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY from the `.env` file):

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY  
```

3. Build the AWS infrastructure by executing these commands in order:

```bash
terraform init
```

```bash
terraform plan
```

- *You will be prompted to make a `master username` and `master password` for accessing the Redshift cluster. Store this information in the `.env` file, as you will need to access this again later.*

```bash
terraform apply
```

4. Destroy the infrastructure (when they are no longer needed):

```bash
terraform destroy
```

- If any issues arise when you try to destroy the infrastructure, go into the AWS console and destroy them manually. But, if you do this, then you have to delete all the files in the `terraform` folder except for `main.tf` and `variables.tf` to remove any history of previous infrastructure builds.  

5. Go to Redshift and locate your cluster in the AWS console. Get the `database name`, `port`, and `host name` (which is just the endpoint URL, but remove the database and port from the URL). Now add it to `.env` because it will be used later.  

6. When you create a Redshift cluster, it is locked down by default so nobody has access to it. To grant other users inbound access to a Redshift cluster, you associate the cluster with a security group. To do this, follow these steps:

    * Go to Redshift and locate your cluster in the AWS console
    * Click on the `VPC security group`
    * Click on `Inbound rules` and then click `Edit Inbound rules`
    * Click `Add rule` and select the following for the new rule: Type = `All traffic`, Source: `0.0.0.0/0`

7. Now, the Redshift cluster should be accessible via pyscopg2 in the following part. But you must create an IAM user in order to run queries in the Redshift cluster. To do this, follow these steps:

    * Go to Redshift and locate your cluster in the AWS console
    * Scroll down and click `Associated IAM roles`
    * Click on `Manage IAM roles`, select `Any S3 bucket`, and select `Create IAM role as default`

*This IAM role will have full command access to Redshift and be able to access any S3 bucket. Generally, this is not recommended for security reasons. But for the purposes of this project, it is fine.*

The infrastructure is now fully up and running!

### 2) Test and Deploy Container to AWS Fargate

AWS Fargate is used to host and execute a container that will:
    - Scrape Indeed.com using Selenium
    - Upload the raw job postings to AWS S3
    - Fix structural errors in the raw data
    - Store the structured data in AWS Redshift  

By default, the script only scrapes one type of job: Software Engineer. In the future, there is room to scrape other jobs as well. But for now, we will scrape 10 pages of that one job every week.  

At first, I intended to use AWS Lambda to trigger the pipeline to run. However, I realized this wasn't necessary and it only added an extra layer of complexity. I encountered a lot of difficulty running headless Chrome in a container. After days of searching, I stumbled across this repo: https://github.com/umihico/docker-selenium-lambda. The repo provides a Dockerfile that builds a container which runs headless-hrome using the AWS Lambda RIE (Runtime Interface Emulator). Even though AWS Lambda isn't being used, this Dockerfile provides a convenient way to Dockerize my Selenium web crawler for deployment to AWS Fargate.

#### Data Pipeline Overview

1. The pipeline starts by executing `get_page_links`, which takes 3 parameters: job title, location of job, and number of pages to scrape. It takes these parameters and generates the Indeed links to each page that is to be scraped.  

2. Each page contains links to the job postings. `get_job_links` is used to grab all the job links on a given page.  

3. The job links are then given to `upload_to_s3` which will call the `scraper` function on each job link to extract all the text from the given job post. It will save the job post as a text file to an s3 bucket. This s3 bucket will serve as a data lake. This function will also return a list of each job posting as a string.  

4. `transformer` is called on the job post strings to extract the job title and the date when the job post was scraped. Each job will be stored in a list as these two attributes.  

5. Then a connection to redshift is established and a table, if it doesn't already exist in the redshift cluster, is created in the `upload_to_redshift` function. Each job's attributes from before are inserted into the table.

    * AWS Redshift is essentially a PostgreSQL database. Thus, psycopg2 was used to connect to the Redshift cluster. To do this, 5 parameters were given: `database name`, `port`, `master username`, `master password`, and the `host` name. These parameters are located in the `.env` file that we generated earlier. These parameters are passed into the container as environmental variables when the container is run.  

#### Instructions

1. Build the image for the data pipeline:

```bash
docker build . \
	--tag scraper:latest
```

2. Run the image (replace the placeholder values with the values in the `.env` file)

```bash
docker run \
    -p 9000:8080 \
    --name scraper \
    -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE' \
    -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY' \
    -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION='us-west-2' \
    -e AWS_REDSHIFT_MASTER_USERNAME='EXAMPLE_USERNAME' \
    -e AWS_REDSHIFT_MASTER_PASSWORD='EXAMPLE_PASSWORD' \
    -e AWS_REDSHIFT_DATABASE_NAME='EXAMPLE_DATABASE' \
    -e AWS_REDSHIFT_PORT='EXAMPLE_PORT' \
    -e AWS_REDSHIFT_HOST='EXAMPLE_HOST' \
    -e AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME='EXAMPLE_BUCKET_NAME' \
    scraper:latest
```

3. Delete the image and container (when they are no longer needed)

```bash
docker kill scraper
docker rm scraper
docker image rm scraper:latest
```

### 3) Test and Deploy Airflow DAG to AWS MWAA

Airflow is used to orchestrate the lambda function. Every week, the DAG will trigger the data pipeline to scrape Indeed for new Software Engineering job postings. Each job posting will be saved as a .txt file in an S3 bucket. The S3 bucket will serve as a data lake. Then the raw data will be transformed using PySpark and uploaded to AWS Redshift. The DAG was developed and tested on a local machine using https://github.com/aws/aws-mwaa-local-runner. Then, the DAG was deployed to AWS MWAA.

#### Steps

1. Build the Docker container image using the following command:
```bash
./mwaa-local-env build-image
```

2. Runs a local Apache Airflow environment that is a close representation of MWAA by configuration.
```bash
./mwaa-local-env start
```

*To stop the local environment, Ctrl+C on the terminal and wait until the local runner and the postgres containers are stopped.*

3. Access the Airflow UI

By default, the `bootstrap.sh` script creates a username and password for your local Airflow environment.

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `test`
- Open the Apache Airlfow UI: <http://localhost:8080/>.

4. Add DAGs and supporting files

- Add DAG code to the `dags/` folder.
- Add Python dependencies to `requirements/requirements.txt`.
    * To test a requirements.txt without running Apache Airflow, use the following script:
    ```bash
    ./mwaa-local-env test-requirements
    ```
- Add custom plugins to the `plugins/` folder.
